# MecAgent Technical Evaluation Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the evaluation results of the MecAgent CAD code generation framework, comparing two training approaches for vision-language models. The evaluation assesses model performance using Valid Syntax Rate (VSR) and Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics on a test dataset of 25 samples.

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

### 2. Training Configuration

The training configuration can be managed through two primary methods:

- **Primary**: Edit `mecagents/config.py` for global configuration settings
- **Alternative**: Modify parameters directly in `train_modular.py`

**Current Configuration**: LoRA fine-tuning targeting MLP layers only

### 3. Training Execution

```bash
# Launch training in background
nohup uv run train_modular.py
```

### 4. Model Inference

```bash
# Update model path in predict.py, then run:
python predict.py
```

### 5. Performance Evaluation

```bash
# Ensure config points to correct model file, then run:
python evaluate_predictions.py
```

## Experimental Results

### Methodology

- **Dataset Size**: 150,000 training examples available
- **Test Set**: 25 samples for evaluation
- **Training Constraint**: Limited training examples due to time constraints
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Valid Syntax Rate (VSR)
  - Intersection over Union (IoU)

### Approach Comparison

#### Base Approach (MLP-Only Training)

**Configuration**: LoRA fine-tuning limited to MLP layers

**Results**:

- **Valid Syntax Rate**: 24% (6/25 successful)
- **Mean IoU**: 0.0271
- **Success Rate**: 24% (6 out of 25 samples)
- **Failed Samples**: 19 out of 25

**Detailed Metrics**:

```json
{
  "vsr": 0.24,
  "successful": 6,
  "total": 25,
  "mean_iou": 0.027109740989397252,
  "failed_samples": 19
}
```

#### Improved Approach (Extended Layer Training)

**Configuration**: Enhanced training targeting additional model layers

**Results**:

- **Valid Syntax Rate**: 24% (6/25 successful)
- **Mean IoU**: 0.0073
- **Success Rate**: 24% (6 out of 25 samples)
- **Failed Samples**: 19 out of 25

**Detailed Metrics**:

```json
{
  "vsr": 0.24,
  "successful": 6,
  "total": 25,
  "mean_iou": 0.00727647018636577,
  "failed_samples": 19
}
```

## Analysis and Findings

### Key Observations

1. **Consistent VSR**: Both approaches achieved identical Valid Syntax Rates (24%)
2. **IoU Variance**: Base approach showed superior IoU performance (0.0271 vs 0.0073)
3. **Limited Training Impact**: Current results reflect training on limited examples due to time constraints

### Performance Interpretation

The base approach (MLP-only training) demonstrates better geometric accuracy as measured by IoU, while maintaining equivalent syntax validity. However, the overall performance metrics indicate significant room for improvement.

## Recommendations for Future Development

### 1. Expanded Training Dataset

- **Current**: Limited samples due to time constraints
- **Proposed**: Utilize full 150,000 example dataset
- **Expected Impact**: Improved model convergence and performance

### 2. Enhanced Model Architecture

- **Current**: LoRA fine-tuning of MLP layers only
- **Proposed**: Extend training to additional model layers
- **Rationale**: Leverage full model capacity with larger dataset

### 3. Advanced Training Methodology

- **Integration**: Implement GPRO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)
- **Metrics**: Incorporate execution success and IoU metrics
- **Benefit**: Direct optimization for task-specific performance measures

## Conclusion

While both approaches show modest performance on the current limited training regime, the base approach (MLP-only training) demonstrates superior geometric accuracy. The framework shows promise for significant improvement through expanded training data utilization and enhanced optimization strategies.

**Next Steps**:

1. Scale training to full dataset (150k examples)
2. Implement GPRO optimization with execution and IoU metrics
3. Conduct comprehensive evaluation on larger test sets
4. Optimize training configuration for extended layer fine-tuning
